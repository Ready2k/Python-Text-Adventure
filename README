First (real) Project - a Python Text Adventure

It seems like everyone does a text adventure for their first programming
project - and I can see why.  They require a whole lot of basic syntax, so
they are great practice and good for committing concepts to memory.  They're
also great to get a small glimpse into an actual software development cycle -
getting a basic program working, refactor, add features, fix bugs, refactor,
etc.  Most importantly, though: creating a text RPG is really fun!

If you end up running this thing or spot any bugs just by looking at the code
feel free to let me know, or offer any suggestions.
